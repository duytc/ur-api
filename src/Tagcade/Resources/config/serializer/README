These files are loaded from a custom jms serializer mapping. Check app/config/config.yml.

The naming of the files is important. Simply remove the Tagcade\ prefix and then replace namespace separators with
periods in the remaining class name.

For example, the class Tagcade\Model\Site has serializer metadata in a file named Model.Site.yml.
